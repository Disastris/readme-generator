# README Generator

## Description

This application creates the basic structure of a README.md file.

It was built with Node.js, the 'inquirer' package, and JavaScript.

The user can enter the following information into the README:
• A Title
• A Description of the project
• How to install the project
• Show the licensing
• How to use the  project

Making this project I learn a little more on how to use Node.Js and have a better understanding on how to make a more professional README file for future projects
